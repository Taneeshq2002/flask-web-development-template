### Flask Introduction and Application Setup: Student Handout

---

### **Overview**

This handout provides a concise guide to getting started with Flask, a popular Python web
development framework. By the end of this guide, you will understand the basics of Flask, how
to set up your environment, and create a simple Flask application.

---

### 1. **What is Flask?**

Flask is a **micro web framework** for Python, known for its simplicity and flexibility. It allows
developers to build web applications with minimal setup and code.

#### Key Features of Flask:

1. **Simplicity**: : Easy to learn and use.
2. **Flexibility**: Add extensions as needed.
3. **Minimal Boilerplate**: Write clean and concise code.
4. **Community Support**:  Access to a large community and resources.

### 2. **Setting Up Flask Environment**

### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure Python is installed on your system:

   ```python
   python --version
   ```
Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if not installed.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

1. Open terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project folder.
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
### Step 3: Install Flask

Install Flask within the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

### 3. **Creating Your First Flask Application**

### Example 1: "Hello World" Application

1. Create a file named app.py.
2. Add the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run(debug=True)
```

### Example 2: Adding Another Route

Add a new route to your application:

   ```python
@app.route('/about')

   def about():

   return 'This is the About page.'
   ```

### Example 3: Custom Greeting

Create a route with a custom greeting:

   ```python
   @app.route('/greet/<name>')

   def greet(name):
      
   return f'Hello, {name}!'
   ```
---

### 4. **Project Structure**

Organize your Flask project as follows:

```plaintext
my_flask_app/
│
├── app.py           # Main application file
├── static/          # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
├── templates/       # HTML templates
└── venv/            # Virtual environment
```
---

### 5. **Running the Flask Development Server**

Go inside the my_flask_app folder:

   ```bash
   cd my_flask_app
   ```

Run your Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
Access your app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

---

### 6. **Understanding Routing and URL Mapping**

Flask uses routing to map URLs to functions. Define routes using the @app.route() decorator.

### Example 1: : Home Route

   ```python
   @app.route('/')

   def home():

   return 'Welcome to the Home Page!'
   ```
### Example 2: : Contact Route

   ```python
   @app.route('/contact')

   def contact():

   return 'Contact us at contact@example.com.'
   ```
### Example 3: : Dynamic Route

   ```python
   @app.route('/user/<username>')

   def show_user_profile(username):

   return f'User: {username}'
   ```
---

### 7. **Using Flask’s Built-in Development Tools**

- **Debugger**:  Provides detailed error messages.
- **Flexibility**: Automatically reloads the app on code changes.

Enable these tools with debug=True :

   ```python
   app.run(debug=True)
   ```
---

### 8. **Conclusion**

This guide covered the basics of Flask, including:

- Setting up a virtual environment and installing Flask.
- Creating a simple Flask application.
- Understanding routing and URL mapping.
- Using Flask’s development tools.

With this foundation, you are ready to explore more advanced Flask topics.
